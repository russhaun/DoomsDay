For Official Use Only (FOUO) is a document designation, not a classification.
This designation is used by Department of Defense and a number of other federal agencies
to identify information or material which, although unclassified, may not be appropriate
for public release. In all cases the designations refer to unclassified, sensitive
information that is or may be exempt from public release under the Freedom of Information
Act. DoD Directive 5400.7 defines For Official Use Only information as unclassified
information that may be exempt from mandatory release to the public under the Freedom of
Information Act (FOIA).The policy is implemented by DoD Regulation 5400.7-R and 5200.1-R.
